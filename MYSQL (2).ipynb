    "ANS--A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of that data. Databases are essential for storing and managing large volumes of structured and unstructured data in a systematic and reliable manner. They are widely used in various applications, from web development and business operations to scientific research and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories of database management systems, and they have several key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "*SQL Databases:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Structured Data*: SQL databases are designed for structured data, which means the data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. Each table contains rows and columns, and the relationship between tables is typically established through foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *ACID Transactions*: SQL databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data consistency and integrity, making them suitable for applications where data accuracy is critical, such as financial systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Schema*: SQL databases require a predefined schema that specifies the structure of the data. Changes to the schema can be complex and may require careful planning and migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Scalability*: SQL databases are traditionally scaled vertically by adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server. While this can be effective, it has practical limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Examples*: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NoSQL Databases:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Flexible Schema*: NoSQL databases are designed for unstructured or semi-structured data. They allow for more flexible schemas, making it easier to adapt to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *BASE Transactions*: NoSQL databases often follow the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model, which prioritizes high availability and scalability over strict consistency. This makes them suitable for distributed and highly available systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Scaling*: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability. They can distribute data across multiple servers, making them well-suited for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Types*: NoSQL databases come in various types, including document stores, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. Each type is optimized for specific data models and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Examples*: MongoDB (document store), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (column-family store), Neo4j (graph database).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on your specific project requirements. SQL databases are a good fit for applications that require structured data, ACID transactions, and data integrity. NoSQL databases are more suitable for applications with flexible data models, high scalability, and the need for rapid development and deployment. Often, hybrid approaches are used where both SQL and NoSQL databases complement each other within a single system to handle diverse data needs."

    "- A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row (record) in that table.\n",
    "- It ensures that there are no duplicate or null values in the specified column(s).\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "In a \"Students\" table, the \"student_id\" column can be designated as the Primary Key. Each student is assigned a unique student ID, and no two students can have the same ID. This enforces data integrity and ensures that each student is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Foreign Key:*\n",
    "- A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that establishes a link between the data in two tables.\n",
    "- It typically references the Primary Key of another table, creating a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "- Foreign Keys are used to enforce referential integrity, ensuring that data in the child table (the table with the Foreign Key) corresponds to data in the parent table (the table with the Primary Key).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"Students\" and \"Courses.\" The \"student_id\" column in the \"Courses\" table can be designated as a Foreign Key, referencing the \"student_id\" column in the \"Students\" table. This creates a relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. The Foreign Key ensures that a student cannot be associated with a non-existent student ID in the \"Students\" table.\n",
